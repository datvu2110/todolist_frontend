# TodoList
TodoList is a simple and intelligent to-do list that makes it easy to plan your day

This repo is the front-end client, built in React.  You can see the app live at [https://todolist2110.herokuapp.com/](https://todolist2110.herokuapp.com/)

The app is meant for mobile use, but will still scale for desktop viewing.

To check out the app, I suggest you create a dummy account so you can see the onboarding experience.  But, if you just want to view what a program looks like, you can use the demo account.

## Introduction

It turns out, our brains are actually wired to keep us thinking about our unfinished tasks. Handy when you have one thing you need to work on. Not so good when you have 30+ tasks vying for your attention at once.

Thatâ€™s why the first step to organizing your work and life is getting everything out of your head and onto your to-do list. From there you can begin to organize and prioritize so you know exactly what to focus on.
